scanner.

// Functionals

/*
RankingFunction[V any] is a functional type that defines the signature for any
function that can determine the relative ordering of two values. The result must
be one of the following:

	-1: The first value is less than the second value.
	 0: The first value is equal to the second value.
	 1: The first value is more than the second value.

The meaning of "less" and "more" is determined by the specific function that
implements this signature.

sets.

Or() returns a new set containing the values that are in either of the specified
sets.

Sans() returns a new set containing the values that are in the first specified
set but not in the second specified set.

Xor() returns a new set containing the values that are in the first specified
set or the second specified set but not both.
