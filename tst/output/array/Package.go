Package "array" provides...

This package follows the Crater Dog Technologies™ Go Coding Conventions located
here:
  - https://github.com/craterdog/go-model-framework/wiki

Additional implementations of the concrete classes provided by this package can
be developed and used seamlessly since the interface definitions only depend on
other interfaces and intrinsic types—and the class implementations only depend
on interfaces, not on each other.

/*
RankingFunction[V any] is a functional type that defines the signature for any
function that can determine the relative ranking of two values.

class constants, constructors and functions that must be supported by each
concrete array-like class.

// Instances

/*
ArrayLike[V any] is an instance interface that defines the complete set of
instance attributes, abstractions and methods that must be supported by each
instance of a concrete array-like class.

An array-like class maintains a fixed length indexed sequence of values.  Each
value is associated with an implicit positive integer index. An array-like class
uses ORDINAL based indexing rather than the more common—and nonsensical—ZERO
based indexing scheme.

	// Attributes
	GetClass() ArrayClassLike[V]

	// Abstractions
	Accessible[V]
	Sequential[V]
	Updatable[V]

	// Methods
	SortValues()
	SortValuesWithRanker(ranker RankingFunction[V])
}

// Aspects

/*
Accessible[V any] is an aspect interface that defines a set of method signatures
that must be supported by each instance of an accessible concrete class.  The
values in an accessible class are accessed using indices. The indices of an
accessible class are ORDINAL rather than ZERO based—which never really made
sense except for pointer offsets.

This approach allows for positive indices starting at the beginning of the
sequence, and negative indices starting at the end of the sequence as follows:

	    1           2           3             N
	[value 1] . [value 2] . [value 3] ... [value N]
	   -N        -(N-1)      -(N-2)          -1

Notice that because the indices are ordinal based, the positive and negative
indices are symmetrical.

NOTE: that sizes should be of type "uint" but the Go language does not allow
arithmetic and comparison operations between "int" and "uint" so we us "int" for
the return type to make it easier to use.
